### **_Description_**

You Buy, not to be confused with Ebay. We are building an application reminiscint of Ebay but closer to craigslist. With this application you will have the ability to create a user and log in. View potential items for sale and sell items yourself.

You will also be able to create a wishlist of items you would like to purchase. Unlike EBAY you can not actually purchase here. You can connect with the seller to purchase using a traditional in person experience.
